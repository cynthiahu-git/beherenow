My web design project describes the the power of living in the now. This inspiration is from one of the chapters of The Power of Now. Many people resist being present in the now by always preferring to be somewhere else. What is happening in the present is never good enough for them. But this only leads to unhappiness.  So I created a story and illustration based on this concept. I also do the coding, made the scrolling experience more interactive while scrolling. There is a man sitting alone and looking for what he desires. The white stones represent his desires. However, he does not realize he has it and starts a journey to search for what he wants. Once he looks inward and anchors himself in the now, like going to the bottom of a lake instead of staying at the surface, he finds himself and realizes he had everything he wanted all along.
